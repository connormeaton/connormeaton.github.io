Below you'll find some of my writing. You'll notice the topics and styles are inconsistent. There will be machine learning tutorials, essays philosophizing about AI and epistemology, and even poems grappling with fuzzy concepts like meaning and transcendance. I feel it is important that all this is integrated in the same repository, for I am not a philosopher, a scientist, or an artist, I am only me. It's either that or I'm too lazy to organize things better.
