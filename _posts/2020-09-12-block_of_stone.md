Be precise in what you are.

You are blessed with the uniquely human right and responsibility to transform the world.

The world needs transformation because it, as it is, is not enough. 

The chaos terrifies and the order oppresses, and it is up to you to find the way through.

You alone see the world as it is, all of its misery and all of its potential.

You alone can make it right.

Be precise in what you are.

You are an artist.

Before you is a block of stone.

You have tools to carve this block of stone, if you wish, into something beautiful.

No one else will carve this block of stone into something, no one else can.

If you do not begin, and if you do not continue, you will die and an uncarved block of stone will remain. 

You have this freedom. But with your freedom, you have been granted responsibility. You are responsible for beauty, and everything you touch can be made so.

This is a heavy burden and it requires great sacrifice. You will lose everything to the process, but you have nothing better to do. Others will try to stop you, for every ideal is a judge. They will try to hurt you, and lay traps with words. They will say things like ‘Beauty is a stone left uncarved’, but they are fools because they do not listen and cowards because they do not act.

So take up your hammer and take up your chisel and go to work, and put your tools down only to sharpen them.

If and when you do not know what to do, look at the other stones carved by the greatness of history.

Study them and master them, for only a fool speaks before they listen.

But do not make a single stroke with your hammer without listening to yourself, for the culture you inherit is dead and you are alive.

The heroes of the past cannot confront the present. Only you can. They can offer knowledge, but they are blind. Knowledge is dead. You must turn it into wisdom, the thing that makes light out of the dark, so that you can see your work before you.

So pick up your hammer.

Listen to the generations, but listen to yourself even more.

Let every stroke of your chisel transform nothing into something, something beautiful.

Do what you are supposed to do, for you will leave this life soon and you will do so only once.

Do this, and die beautifully.
