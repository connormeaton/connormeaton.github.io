I unfold into understanding like a fern,

From darkness and death and mystery into light, knowing, and vulnerability, 

I breath.


For a long time I did not see,

Not because I had no eyes,

But because I did not open them.

The womb of ignorance cared for me well,

But I am here.

Soon, I will not be.

So I want to know what this place is,

I want to see it all,

I want to leave no stone unturned.

I want to burden my hands with dirt from the digging,

I want to wash them in water,

I want to dry them in light,

I want to do it over again.



Again and again,
I go deeper,

Until my hands are scarred and soiled,

And the walls of the pit tower over my head,

But there is always enough water to wash,

Enough light to dry.


The deeper I’ve gone into things, the more I’ve understood

That everything is in one thing.


All the suffering, all of the joy,

Each murder from every genocide,

And the first kiss from every lover,

Is recorded in this one thing,

Right here.


To see this,

Even only for a moment,

Is enough.
